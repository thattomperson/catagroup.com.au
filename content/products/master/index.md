Sewage holding tanks need to be vented. The best way for your
tank to breathe and remove the bad smell known as Hydrogen
Sulfide (H2S) is to have a quality Activated Carbon filter in the vent
line. Master Vent is made for maximum removal of H2S odours.

municipal sewage treatment plants in Australia, USA & Europe.
