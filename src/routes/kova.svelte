            Sewage holding tanks need to be vented. The best way for your waste tank
            to breathe and remove the bad smell known as Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) is to
            have a quality impregnated Activated Carbon filter in the vent line.
            Master Vent is purpose made for maximum removal of H2S odours.
            Master Vent is an industrial grade OxPure Activated Carbon filter that is
            impregnated with Potassium Hydroxide (KOH). This is the same impregnated
            Activated Carbon used in commercial municipal sewage treatment plants in
            Australia, USA & Europe.
          </p>
          <p class="leading-relaxed text-lg mb-4">
            Australian made and designed for easy installation by having a multiple staged
            tail for different size hoses 16mm-5/8" 19mm-3/4" 25mm-1" 38mm-1 1/2".
            Master Vent comes with a mount kit, but for easy change over it will also fit
            into other brand brackets like Sealand, Dometic, Airforce etc.
            Filled with 350 grams of OxPure industrial grade impregnated Activated KOH
            Carbon makes Master Vent one of heaviest and longer lasting
            odour filters on the market.
